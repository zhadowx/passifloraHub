      <h3 id="html-1">What is HTML?</h3>
      <p>The HyperText Markup Language is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and
        structure of web content.</p>
      <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into
        multimedia web pages.</p>
      <p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as
        interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents
        by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.
        HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input
        /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information
        about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use
        them to interpret the content of the page.</p>
      <h3 id="html-2">Element Display Roles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Block-Level:</b> element box fills its parent element's content area width and cannot have other
          elements to its sides. Example: &lt;p&gt; and &lt;div&gt;.</li>
        <li><b>Inline-Level:</b> element box is generated within a line of text and does not break up the flow of
          that line. Example: &lt;a&gt; and &lt;span&gt;.</li>

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <h3 id="css-1">What is CSS?</h3>
      <p>CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
        This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
        of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relecant CSS
        in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content as well as enabling
        the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file.</p>
      <p>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more
        than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>
      <p>The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).</p>
      <h3 id="css-2">Selectors</h3>
      <details>

          <li>Class selector: <i>.classname</i></li>
          <li>ID selector: <i>#idname</i></li>
          <li>Attribute selector: [<i>attr=value</i>]</li>
        </ul>
      </details>
      <h4>Grouping selectors</h4>
      <details>
        <summary>Selector list <b>A, B</b></summary>
        Specifies that both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> elements are selected.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Adjacent sibling combinator <b>A + B</b></summary>
        Specifies that the elements selected by both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have the same parent and that the element
        selected by <i>B</i> immediately follows the element selected by <i>A</i> horizontally.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>General sibling combinator <b>A ~ B</b></summary>
        Specifies that the elements selected by both <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> share the same parent and that the element
        selected by <i>A</i> comes before⎼but not necessarily immediately before⎼the element selected by <i>B</i>.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Child combinator <b>A > B</b></summary>
        Specifies that the element selected by <i>B</i> is the direct child of the element selected by <i>A</i>.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Descendant combinator <b>A B</b></summary>
        Specifies that the element selected by <i>B</i> is a descendant of the element selected by <i>A</i>, but is
        not
        necessarily a direct child.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Pseudo classes <b>:</b></summary>
        Specifies a special state of the selected element(s).
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Pseudo elements <b>::</b></summary>
        Represents entities that are not included in HTML.
      </details>
      <h3 id="css-3">Style Precedence</h3>
      <p>Cascading Style Sheets uses a mechanism called the <i>cascade</i> to resolve any conflicts between styles
        and arrive at a final set of styles to be applied to the document. Two key components of the cascade are
        specificity and inheritance.</p>
      <h4>Specificity</h4>
      <p><i>Specificity</i> describes the weight of a selector and any declarations associated with it.</p>

      </table>
      <h4>Inheritance</h4>
      <p>CSS uses the document tree for the mechanism of <i>inheritance</i>, in which a style applied to an element is
        inherited by its descendants. Inheritance is interrupted only by a conflicting style rule that applies
        directly
        to an element. Inherited values have no specificity at all (which is <i>not</i> the same as having zero
        specificity).</p>
      <h3 id="css-4">The Box Model</h3>
      <p>In CSS there are broadly two types of boxes— <b>block boxes</b> and <b>inline boxes</b>. The CSS box model as
        a
        whole applies to block boxes. Inline boxes use just some of the behavior defined in the box model. The model
        defines how the different parts of a box—margin, border, padding, and content— work together to create a box
        that you can see on a page.</p>
      <h4>Standard CSS box model</h4>
      <p>In the standard box model, if you give a box a <i>width</i> and a <i>height</i> attribute, this defines the
        width and height of the <i>content box</i>. Any padding and border is then added to that width and height to
        get
        the total size taken up by the box. Example:</p>
      <div class="standardBox">
        <p>Standard CSS Box Model</p>
      </div>
      <p>The <i>actual space</i> taken up by the box will be 350px wide (300px + 20px + 20px + 5px + 5px) and 80px
        high
        (30px + 20px + 20px + 5px + 5px).</p>
      <h4>Alternativve CSS box model</h4>
      <p>In this model, any width is the width of the visible box on the page, therefore the content area width is
        that
        width minus the width for the padding and border. Example using same width and height than previous
        case:
      </p>
      <div class="alternateBox">
        <p>Alternative CSS Box Model</p>
      </div>
      <p>By default, browsers use the standard box model. If you want to turn on the alternative model for an element,
        you do so by setting <i>box-sizing: border-box;</i> on it.</p>
      <h3 id="css-5">Backgrounds</h3>
      <p>The <i>background-color</i> property defines the background color of any element in CSS. The property accepts
        any valid &lt;color&gt;. A <i>background-color</i> extends underneath the content and padding box of the
        element. Example:</p>
      <div class="containerBackgroundColor">
        <div id="backgroundColorBox">
          <h4>Background Colors</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>The <i>background-image</i> property enables the display of an image in the background of an element. Also,
        if
        you specify a background color in addition to a background image then the image displays on top of the color.
        Example:</p>
      <div class="containerBackgroundImage">
        <div id="backgroundImageBox">
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 id="css-6">Rounded Corners</h3>
      <p>Rounding corners on a box is achieved by using the <i>border-radius</i> property. You can set a single radius
        to make circular corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners. The radius applies to the whole background,
        even if the element has no border. Examples:</p>
      <div class="radiusBoxes">
        <p>
          Radius is set for all 4 sides <br>
          <code>border-radius: 10%;</code>
        </p>
        <div class="boxRadius1">
        </div>
        <p>
          top-left-and-bottom-right | top-right-and-bottom-left <br>
          <code>border-radius: 25% 5%;</code>
        </p>
        <div class="boxRadius2">
        </div>
        <p>
          top-left | top-right | bottom-right | bottom_left <br>
          <code>border-radius: 10% 20% 30% 50%;</code>
        </p>
        <div class="boxRadius3">
        </div>
        <p>
          Horizontal all 4 corners / Vertical all 4 corners <br>
          <code>border-radius: 10% / 50%;</code>
        </p>
        <div class="boxRadius4">
        </div>
        <p>
          top-left-and-bottom-right | top-right-and-bottom-left / all 4 corners <br>
          <code>border-radius: 5% 15% / 35%;</code>
        </p>
        <div class="boxRadius5">

      <h3 id="css-7">Box Shadow</h3>
      <p>The <i>box-shadow</i> property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects
        separated by commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread
        radius, and color.</p>
      <p>The <i>box-shadow</i> property enables you to cast a drop shadow from the frame of almost any element. If a
        <i>border-radius</i> is specified on the element with a box shadow, the box shadow takes on the same rounded
        corners.
      </p>
      <p>Values:</p>
      <details>
        <summary><b>inset</b></summary>
        If not specified (default), the shadow is assumed to be a drop shadow (as if the box were raised above the
        content). The presence of the <i>inset</i> keyword changes the shadow to one inside the frame (as if the
        content
        was depressed inside the box). Inset shadows are drawn inside the border (even transparent ones), above the
        background, but below content.
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><b>&lt;offset-x&gt; &lt;offset-y&gt;</b></summary>
        These are two &lt;length&gt; values to set the shadow offset. &lt;offset-x&gt; specifies the horizontal
        distance. Negative values place the shadow to the left of the element. &lt;offset-y&gt; specifies the vertical
        distance. Negative values place the shadow above the element. If both values values are 0, the shadow is
        placed
        behind the element (and may generate a blur effect if &lt;blur-radius&gt; and/or &lt;spread-radius&gt; is
        set).
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><b>&lt;blur-radius&gt;</b></summary>
        This is a third &lt;length&gt; value. The larger this value, the bigger the blur, so the shadow becomes bigger
        and lighter. Negative values are not allowed. If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow's edge is sharp).
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary><b>&lt;spread-radius&gt;</b></summary>
        This is a fourth &lt;length&gt; value. Positive values will cause the shadow to expand and grow bigger,
        negative
        values will cause the shadow to shrink. If not specified, it will be 0 (the shadow will be the same size as
        the
        element).
      </details>

      <h3 id="css-9">Transitioning Between States</h3>
      <p>The <i>transition</i> CSS property is a shorthand property for <i>transition-property</i>,
        <i>transition-duration</i>,
        <i>transition-timing-function</i> and <i>transition-delay</i>.
      </p>
      <p>Transitions enable you to define the transition between two states of an element. Different states may be
        defined using <i>pseudo-classes</i> like <i>:hover</i> or <i>:active</i> or dynamically set using JavaScript.
      </p>
      <h4>Constituent Properties</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><i>transition-delay</i>: specifies the duration to wait starting a property's transition effect when its
          value changes. The delay may be zero, positive or negative:
          <ul>
            <li>A value of 0s will begin the transition immediately.</li>
            <li>A positive value will delay the start of the transition effect for the given length of time.</li>
            <li>A negative value will begin the transition effect immediately, and partway through the effect. In
              other
              words, the effect will be animated as if it had already been running for the given length of time.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><i>transition-duration</i>: sets the length of time a transition animation should take to complete. By
          default, the value is 0s, meaning that no animation will occur.</li>
        <li><i>transition-property</i>: sets the CSS properties to which a transition effect should be applied.</li>
        <li><i>transition-timing-function</i>: sets how intermediate values are calculated for CSS properties being
          affected by a transition effect. This, in essence, lets you establish an acceleration curve so that the
          speed
          of the transition can vary over its duration. This acceleration curve is defined using one
          &lt;easing-function&gt; for each property to be transitioned.</li>

      <h3 id="css-10">Animations</h3>
      <p><b>CSS Animations</b> make it possible to animate transitions from one CSS style
        configuration to another.
        Animations consists of two components, a style describing the CSS animation and a set of keyframes that
        indicate
        the start (sometimes intermediate waypoints) and end states of the animation's style.</p>
      <p>To create a CSS animation sequence, you style the element you want to animate with the <i>animation</i>
        property or its sub-properties. This lets you configure the timing, duration, and other details of how the
        animation sequence should progress. This does <b>not</b> configure the actual
        appearance of the animation, which
        is done using <i>@keyframes</i> at-rule.</p>
      <p>The sub-properties of the animation property are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>animation-name</i>: specifies the name of the @keyframes at-rule describing the animation's keyframes.
        </li>
        <li><i>animation-duration</i>: configures the length of time an animation should take to complete one cycle.
        </li>
        <li><i>animation-timing-function</i>: configures the timing of the animation; that is, how the animation
          transitions through keyframes, by establishing acceleration curves.</li>
        <li><i>animation-delay</i>: configures the delay between the time the element is loaded and the beginning of
          the
          animation sequence.</li>
        <li><i>animation-iteration-count</i>: configures the number of times the animation should repeat; you can
          specify infinite to repeat the animation indefinitely.</li>
        <li><i>animation-direction</i>: configures whether or not the animation should alternate direction on each run
          through the sequence or reset to the start point and repeat itself.</li>
        <li><i>animation-fill-mode</i>: configures what values are applied by the animation before and after
          executing.
        </li>
        <li><i>animation-play-state</i>: lets you pause and resume the animation sequence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <h3 id="js-1">What is JavaScript?</h3>
      <p>JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
        The
        language has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers. It has made modern web applications
        possible—applications with which you can interact directly without doing a page reload for every action.
        JavaScript is also used in more traditional websites to provide various forms of interactivity and cleverness.
      </p>
      <p>JavaScript(JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with
        first-class-functions. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language,
        supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.</p>
      <h3 id="js-2">Grammar, Values and Types</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is <b>case-sensitive</b> and uses the Unicode character set.</p>
      <p>An <i>expression</i> in JavaScript is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value. Every syntactically
        valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side
        effects(those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to
        a
        value.</p>
      <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons <b>(;)</b>. Which means
        that
        any
        JavaScript expression ending with a semicolon is also a statement.</p>
      <p>The source code text of JavaScript gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input
        elements which are <i>tokens</i>, <i>control characters</i>, <i>line-terminators</i>, <i>comments</i>, or
        whitespace.</p>
      <p>In JavaScript values are chunks of information that represent pieces of information. Every value has a type
        that determines its role. There are eight data types, 7 primitive data types and objects.</p>
      <h4>The 7 primitive data types:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Number: </b>Floating point numbers. Used for decimals and integers.</li>
        <li><b>String: </b> Sequence of characters. Used for text.</li>
        <li><b>Boolean: </b>Logical type that can only be <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. Used for taking decisions.</li>
        <li><b>Undefined: </b>Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value').</li>
        <li><b>Null: </b>Also means 'empty value'.</li>
        <li><b>Symbol(ES2015): </b>Value that is unique and cannot be changed.</li>
        <li><b>BigInt(ES2020): </b>Larger integers than the Number type can hold.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Data type conversion</h4>
      <p>JavaScript is a <i>dynamically typed</i> language. This means you don't have to specify the data type of a
        variable when you declare it. It also means that data types are automatically converted as-needed during
        script
        execution.</p>
      <h4>Declarations</h4>
      <p>JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>var</b>: declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
        <li><b>let</b>: declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</li>
        <li><b>const</b>: declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Variables are used as symbolic names for values in the programs. The names of variables, called identifiers,
        conform to certain rules.</p>
      <h5>Variable Scope</h5>
      <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a <i>global</i> variable, because it is
        available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
        called
        a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
      <h5>Variable hoisting</h5>
      <p>You can refer to a variable declared later, without getting an exception. This concept is knows as
        <b>hoisting</b>. Variables in JavaScript are "hoisted" (or "lifted") to the top of the function or statement.
        However, variables that are hoisted return a value of <i>undefined</i>.
      </p>
      <h4>Literals</h4>
      <p><i>Literals</i> represent values in JavaScript. These are fixed values—not variables—that you
        <i>literally</i>
        provide in your script. There are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Array literal: a list of zero or more expressions, each of which represents an array element, enclosed in
          square brackets ([]).</li>
        <li>Boolean literal: <b>true</b> and <b>false</b>.</li>
        <li>Floating-point literals: can have an unsigned decimal integer, a decimal point (.), a fraction, or an
          exponent(e).</li>
        <li>Numeric literal: include integer literals in different bases as well as floating-point literals in
          base-10.
        </li>
        <li>Object literal: is a list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values of an object,
          enclosed in curly braces ({}).</li>
        <li>RegExp literal: is a pattern enclosed between slashes (/ /).</li>
        <li>String literal: is zero or more characters enclosed in double(") or single (') quotation marks. A string
          must be delimited by quotations marks of the same type. Also there are <i>template literals</i> which are
          enclosed by the back-tick <b>(` ` )</b> characters instead of double or single quotes and provide syntactic
          sugar
          for
          constructing strings.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="js-3">Operators</h3>
      <p>JavaScript has the following types of operators:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <span>Assignment</span>: assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The
          simple
          assignmet operator
          is equal <b>(=)</b>.</li>
        <li><span>Comparison</span>: compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison
          is true. The
          operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.
          <ul>
            <li>Equal <b>(==)</b></li>
            <li>Not equal <b>(!=)</b></li>
            <li>Strict equal <b>(===)</b></li>
            <li>Strict not equal <b>(!==)</b></li>
            <li>Greater than <b>(&gt;)</b></li>
            <li>Greater than or equal <b>(&gt;=)</b></li>
            <li>Less than <b>(&lt;)</b> </li>
            <li>Less than or equal <b>(&lt;=)</b> </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span>Arithmetic</span>: takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and
          returns
          a single
          numerical value. The standard arithmetic operators are addition <b>(+)</b> , subtraction <b>(-)</b> ,
          multiplication <b>(*)</b>, and
          division <b>(/)</b>. In addition there are also:
          <ul>
            <li>Remainder <b>(%)</b> : binary operator that returns the integer remainder of dividing the two
              operands.
            </li>
            <li>Increment <b>(++)</b> : unary operator that adds one to its operand.</li>
            <li>Decrement <b>(--)</b> : unary operator that subtracts one from its operand.</li>
            <li>Unary negation <b>(-)</b> : unary operator that returns the negation of its operand.</li>
            <li>Unary plus <b>(+)</b> : unary operator that attempts to convert operand to a number, if it is not
              already.</li>
            <li>Exponentiation operator <b>(**)</b> : calculates the base to the exponent power, that is,
              base^exponent.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span>Bitwise operator</span>: treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as
          decimal,
          hexadecimal, or
          octal numbers. Bitwise operators perform their operations on such <b>binary representations</b>, but they
          return standard JavaScript numerical values.</li>
        <li><span>Logical operators</span>: are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they
          return
          a Boolean
          value.
          However, the <b>&&</b> and <b>||</b> operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands,
          so
          if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.
          <ul>
            <li>Logical AND <b>(&&)</b>: Returns left-hand operand if it can be converted to false; otherwise returns
              right-hand operand. Thus, when used with Boolean values, returns <i>true</i> if both operands are true;
              otherwise, returns <i>false</i>.</li>
            <li>Logical OR <b>(||)</b>: Returns left-hand operand if it can be converted to true; otherwise, returns
              right-hand operand. Thus, when used with Boolean values, returns <i>true</i> if either operand is true;
              if
              both are false returns <i>false</i>.</li>
            <li>Logical NOT <b>(!)</b>: Returns <i>false</i> if its single operand can be converted to true;
              otherwise,
              returns <i>true</i>.</li>
            <li>Nullish coalescing operator <b>(??)</b>: returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side
              operand is <i>null</i> or <i>undefined</i>, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span>String</span>: in addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the
          concatenation
          operator <b>(+)</b> concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of
          the
          two operand strings.</li>
        <li><span>Conditional or ternary operator</span> <b>(?:)</b>: is the only JavaScript operator that takes three
          operands and the syntax is
          <b>(condition ? val1 : val2)</b>; meaning that if condition is true, the operator returns val1, otherwise it
          returns val2.
        </li>
        <li><span>Optional Chaining operator</span> <b>(?.)</b>: enables you to read the value of a property located
          deep within a
          chain of connected objects without having to check that each reference in the chain is valid. Basically is
          like the chaining operator <b>(.)</b>, except that instead of causing an error if a reference is <i>nullish
            (null or undefined)</i>, the expression shot-circuits with a return value of <i>undefined</i>.</li>
        <li><span>Comma</span> <b>(,)</b>: evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand.
          This operator is
          primarily used inside a <i>for</i> loop, to allow multiple variables to be updated each time through the
          loop.
        </li>
        <li><span>Unary</span>: operate with a single operand.
          <ul>
            <li><b>delete</b>: deletes an object's property.</li>
            <li><b>typeof</b>: returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand.</li>
            <li><b>void</b>: specifies an expression to be evaluated without returning a value.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span>Relational</span>: compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison
          is true.
          <ul>
            <li><b>in</b>: returns true if the specified property is in the specified object.</li>
            <li><b>instanceof</b>: returns true if the specified object is of the specified object type.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="js-4">Control Flow</h3>
      <p>Statements in JavaScript are executed from top to bottom. </p>
      <h4>Block statement</h4>
      <p>The block is defined by a pair of curly brackets <b>({})</b>, and is used to group statements.</p>
      <h4>Conditional statements</h4>
      <p>A conditional statement is a set of commands that executes if a specified condition is true. JavaScript
        supports two conditional statements: <b>if...else...</b> and <b>switch</b>.</p>
      <h4>Falsy values</h4>
      <p>A <i>falsy</i> value is a value that is considered false when encountered in a Boolean context.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>undefined</li>
        <li>null</li>
        <li>0</li>
        <li>NaN</li>
        <li>empty string ("")</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="js-5">Loops and Iteration</h3>
      <p>Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program where we were before and repeat it
        with
        our current program state.</p>
      <h4>while loop</h4>
      <p>A statement starting with the keyword <i>while</i> creates a loop. The word <i>while</i> is followed by an
        expression in parentheses and then a statement. The loop keeps entering that stement as long as the expression
        produces a value that gives <i>true</i> when converted to Boolean. This is usually accompanied by a binding
        within the body of the loop to keep track of the progress of a program.</p>
      <h4>for loop</h4>
      <p>A <i>for</i> loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to <i>false</i>. The main difference between
        the <i>while</i> loop and the <i>for</i> loop is that the latter provides a slightly shorter and more
        comprehensive form.</p>
      <p>The parentheses after a <i>for</i> keyword must contain two semicolons. The part before the first semicolon
        <i>initializes</i> the loop, usually by defining a binding. The second part is the expression that
        <i>checks</i>
        whether the loop must continue. The final part <i>updates</i> the state of the loop after every iteration.
      </p>
      <h4>for... in</h4>
      <p>Iterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object. For each distinct property. In
        other words, iterates over property names.</p>
      <h4>for...of</h4>
      <p>Creates a loop iterating over iterable objects (including Array, Map, Set, arguments object and so on),
        invoking a custom iteration hook with statements to be executed for the value of each distinct property. In
        other words, iterates over property values.</p>
      <h3 id="js-6">Functions</h3>
      <p>A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a
        value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where
        there
        is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. In simpler words, a function is a piece of
        program wrapped in a value.</p>
      <p>There are fundamentally three ways in which you can create a function:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Function declaration: is a function that can be used before it's declared.</li>
        <li>Function expression: essentially is a function value stored in a variable.</li>
        <li>Arrow functions: great for quick one-line functions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Executing a function is called <i>invoking</i>, <i>calling</i>, or <i>applying</i> it.</p>
      <h4>Structure of a function</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Function name: the name of the binding that holds the function.</li>
        <li>Parameters: placeholders to receive input values. Like local variables of a function.</li>
        <li>Function body: block of code that we want to reuse. Processes the function's input data.</li>
        <li>return statement: to output a value from the function and terminate execution.</li>
        <li>Arguments: actual values of function parameters, to input data.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Scope</h4>
      <p>Variables defined inside a function cannot be accessed from anywhere outside the function, because the
        variable
        is defined only in the scope of the function. However, a function can access all variables and functions
        defined
        inside the scope in which it is defined.</p>
      <p>A function can refer to and call itself. A function that calls itself is called a <i>recursive function</i>,
        which is, in some ways, analogous to a loop, in that both execute the same code multiple times.</p>
      <h4>Nesting and closures</h4>
      <p>You can nest a function within another function. The inner function is private to its outer function. Also,
        it
        forms a <i>closure</i>.</p>
      <p><b>Closure</b> is the <i>variable environment</i> (VE) attached to the function, exactly as it was at the
        time
        and place the function was created. In other words, a <i>closure</i> gives a function access to all the
        variables of its parent function, even after that parent function has returned. The function keeps a reference
        to its outer scope, which preserves the scope chain throughout time.</p>
      <h4>First-Class vs. Higher-Order Functions</h4>
      <p><b>First-Class Functions</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript treats functions as first-class citizens.</li>
        <li>This means that functions are simply values.</li>
        <li>Functions are just another "type" of object.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Higher-Order Functions</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A function that <b>receives</b> another function (<b>callback function</b>) as an argument, that
          <b>returns</b> a new function, or <b>both</b>.
        </li>
        <li>This is only possible because of first-class functions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="js-7">Strings</h3>
      <p>JavaScript's string type is used to represent textual data. It is a set of "elements" of 16-bit unsigned
        integer values (UTF-16 code units). Each element in the String occupies a position in the String. The first
        element is at index 0, the next at index 1, etc. You can create strings using <i>string literals</i> or
        <i>string objects</i>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>String literals</span>: are created by enclosing characters in single or double quotes.</li>
        <li><span>String objects</span>: is a wrapper around the string primitive data type.</li>
        <li><span>Multi-line template literals</span>: are string literals allowing embedded expressions. You can use
          multi-line strings and string interpolation features with them. Created by enclosing characters with
          back-ticks <b>( ` ` )</b>, which can contain placeholders (indicated with Dollar sign and curly braces
          <b>${expression}</b>).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Values of type string, number, and Boolean are not objects, and though the language doesn't complain if you
        try
        to set new properties on them, it doesn't actually store those properties, because such values are immutable
        and
        cannot be changed.</p>
      <p>However you can call methods on a string literal value. So, what happens is that JavaScript automatically
        converts the string literal to a temporary String object, calls the method, then discards the temporary String
        object.</p>
      <h3 id="js-8">Arrays</h3>
      <p>Arrays are a reference data type for storing sequences of values. The easiest or preferred way of creating an
        array is by enclosing elements in square brackets <b>([])</b> and separating them with a comma <b>(,)</b>,
        this
        is called an array literal or bracket syntax.</p>
      <p>The notation for getting at the elements inside an array also uses square brackets. A pair of square brackets
        immediately after an expression, with another expression inside of them, will look up the element in the
        left-hand expression that corresponds to the <i>index</i> given by the expression in brackets.</p>
      <p>Just like Strings the first index of an array is zero, not one.</p>
      <h4>Accessing Properties</h4>
      <p>The two main ways to access properties in JavaScript are with a dot <b>(.)</b> and with square brackets
        <b>([])</b>. Both <b>value.x</b> and <b>value[x]</b> access a property on value—but not necessarily the same
        property. The difference is in how <i>x</i> is interpreted. When using a dot, the word after the dot is the
        literal name of the property. When using square brackets, the expression between the brackets is
        <i>evaluated</i> to get the property name. In other words, whereas <b>value.x</b> fetches the property of
        value
        named <i>x</i>, <b>value[x]</b> tries to evaluate the expression <i>x</i> and uses the result, converted to a
        string, as the property name.
      </p>
      <p>The elements in an array are stored as the arrays's properties, using numbers as property names. You can't
        use
        the dot notation with numbers, this is the reason why you have to use the bracket notation to get at them.</p>
      <h3 id="js-9">Objects</h3>
      <p>An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name <i>(or key)</i> and
        a
        value. A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.</p>
      <h4>Creating new objects</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Object initializers</span> <b>({property1: value1, property2: value2})</b>: referred to as creating
          objects with literal notation.</li>
        <li><span>Constructor function</span>:
          <ol>
            <li>Create a function for the object type that specifies its name (capital initial letter), properties,
              and
              methods.</li>
            <li>Create an instance of the object with <b>new</b>.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li><span>Object.create() method</span>: this method allows you to choose the prototype object for the object
          you want to create, wihtout having to define a constructor function.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>this keyword</h4>
      <p>The <b>this keyword/variable</b> is a special variable that is created for every execution context (every
        function) that takes the value of (points to) the "owner" of the function in which the <i>this</i> keyword is
        used.</p>
      <p><i>this</i> is NOT static. It depends on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned when the
        function is actually called.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Method</b>: <i>this</i> points to the Object that is calling the method.</li>
        <li><b>Alone</b>: <i>this</i> points to the Global object.</li>
        <li><b>Simple function call</b>: <i>this</i> points to undefined (when in strict mode, otherwise the Global
          object, e.g., <i>window object</i> in the browser).</li>
        <li><b>Arrow functions</b>: <i>this</i> points to the <i>this</i> of the surrounding function (lexical
          <i>this</i>).
        </li>
        <li><b>Event listener</b>: <i>this</i> points to the DOM element that the handler is attached to.</li>
        <li><b>new, call, apply, bind</b>: can refer <i>this</i> to point to any object</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="js-10">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</h3>
      <p>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects are used to
        describe real-world or abstract features. Objects are building blocks of applications, and interact with one
        another. Interactions happen through a public interface (API): methods that the code outside of the object can
        access and use to communicate with the object.</p>
      <h4>Abstraction</h4>
      <p>Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective of the thing we are
        implementing, instead of messing with details that don't really matter to our implementation.</p>
      <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
      <p>Keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from outside the class.
        Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API).</p>
      <h4>Inheritance</h4>
      <p>Making all properties and methods of a certain class available to a child class, forming a hierarchical
        relationship between classes. This allows us to reuse common logic and to model real-world relationships.</p>
      <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
      <p>A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a parent class.</p>

      <h3 id="js-11">Inheritance and the Prototype Chain</h3>
      <p>Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its <b>prototype</b>. That
        prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with a <i>null</i> as its
        prototype, which has no prototype, and acts as the final link in the <b>prototype chain</b>.</p>
      <p>The prototype relations of JavaScript objects form a tree-shaped structure, and at the root of this structure
        sits <b>Object.prototype</b>.</p>
      <h4>Classes</h4>
      <p>JavaScript's prototype system can be interpreted as a somewhat informal take on an object-oriented concept
        called <i>classes</i>. A class defines the shape of a type of object—what methods and properties it has. Such
        an
        object is called an instance of the class.</p>
      <p>Prototypes are useful for defining properties for which all instances of a class share the same value, such
        as
        methods. Properties that differ per instance, need to be stored directly in the objects themselves.</p>
      <h4>Ways to implement prototypal inheritance</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Constructor Functions</span>
          <ul>
            <li>Just a function that happens to be called with the <i>new</i> operator.</li>
            <li>Technique to create objects from a function.</li>
            <li>This is how built-in objects like Arrays, Maps or Sets are actually implemented.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span>ES6 Classes</span>
          <ul>
            <li>Modern alternativeto constructor function syntax.</li>
            <li>"Syntactic sugar"; behind the scenes, ES6 classes work exactly like constructor functions.</li>
            <li>ES6 classes do NOT behave like classes in "classical OOP".</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span>Object.create()</span>
          <ul>
            <li>The easiest and most straightforward way of linking an object to a prototype object.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="js-12">The Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
      <p>The DOM connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of a
        document—such
        as the HTML representing a web page—in memory. The Document Object Model is an architecture that describes the
        structure of a document; each document is represented by an instance of the interface Document. A document, in
        turn, consists of a hierarchical tree of <b>nodes</b>, in which a node is a fundamental record representing a
        single object wihtin the document.</p>
      <p>Nodes may be strictly organizational ,providing a means for grouping other nodes together or for providing a
        point at which a hierarchy can be constructed; other nodes may represent visible components of a document.</p>
      <p>Nodes don't have any concept of including the content that is actually displayed in the document. They're
        empty
        vessels. Some of the features added to the Document by the HTML standard are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Support for accessing various information provided by the HTTP headers when loading the page, such as the
          location from which the document was loaded, cookies, modification date, etc.</li>
        <li>Access to list elements in the document.</li>
        <li>Support for interacting with the user.</li>
        <li>Event handlers for document events defined by the HTML standard to allow access to mouse and keyboard
          events, drag and drop, etc.</li>
        <li>Event handlers for events that can be delivered to both elements and documents; presently only copy, cut
          and
          paste actions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Also, an element inherits the properties and methods of all its ancestors. Each level defines a key aspect of
        the utility of the element. From Node, the element inherits concepts surrounding the ability for the element
        to
        be contained by another element, and to contain other elements itself. Of special importance is what is gained
        by inheriting from EventTarget, which is the ability to receive and handle events such as mouse clicks, play
        and
        pause events, and so forth.</p>
      <h4>Propagation</h4>
      <p>For most event types, handlers registered on nodes with children will aso receive events that happen in the
        children. If a button inside a paragraph is clicked, event hanlders on the paragraph will also see the click
        event.</p>
      <p>Events are said to propagate outward, from the node where it happened to that node's parent node and on the
        the
        root of the document.Finally, after all handlers registered on a specific node have had their turn, handlers
        registered on the whole window got a chance to respond to the event.</p>
      <p>Most event objects have a <i>target</i> property that refers to the node where they originated. You can use
        this property to ensure that you're not accidentally handling something that propagated up from a node you do
        not want to handle. It is also possible to use the <i>target</i> property to cast a wide net for a specific
        type
        of event.</p>
      <h3 id="js-13">Asynchronicity</h3>
      <p>JavaScript is traditionally <b>single-threaded</b>. Even with multiple cores, you could only get it to run
        tasks on a single thread, called the main thread. After some time, JavaScript gained some tools to help with
        such problems. <b>Web workers</b> allow you to send some of the JavaScript processing off to a separate
        thread,
        called a worker so that you can run multiple chunks simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Web workers are pretty useful, but they do have their limitations. A major one is they are not able to access
        the DOM. Another problem is that although code run in a worker is not blocking(refers to code that executes
        without returning control to the browser), it is still basically synchronous.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An <i>asynchronous</i> model allows multiple things to happen at the same time.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous code is non-blocking.</li>
        <li>Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finish it's work.</li>
        <li>Callback functions alone do NOT make code asynchronous.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>AJAX</h4>
      <p><b>A</b>synchronous <b>J</b>avaScrypt <b>A</b>nd <b>X</b>ML. Allows us to communicate with remote web servers
        in an asynchronous way. With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically using a technology
        known as XMLHttpRequest.</p>
      <p>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retreive data from a URL without
        having
        to do a full page refresh. Despite its name, XHR can be used to retrieve any type of data, not just XML.</p>
      <p>There have been a number of developments in the techonologies used in AJAX application, and in the definition
        of the term AJAX itself. XML is no longer required for data interchange and, therefore, XSLT is no longer
        required for the manipulation of data. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is often used as an alternative
        format
        for data interchange, although other formats such as preformatted HTML or plain text can also be used.</p>
      <h4>Promises</h4>
      <p>Promises are the new style of async code that you'll see used in modern Web APIs. A good example is the
        <b>fetch()</b> API, which is basically like a modern, more efficient version of XMLHttpRequest.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A promise is an object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.
        </li>
        <li>We no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into asynchronous functions to handle
          asynchronous
          results.</li>
        <li>Instead of nesting callbacks, we can <b>chain promises</b> for a sequence of asynchronous operations: thus
          escaping <b>callback hell <span id="devil">👹</span></b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Promise Lifecycle</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Pending</b>: Before the future value is available.</li>
        <li><b>Settled</b>: Asynchronous task has finished.
          <ul>
            <li><b>Fulfilled</b>: Success, the value is now available.</li>
            <li><b>Rejected</b>: An error, value not available.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Async/Await</h4>
      <p>JavaScript allows you to write pseudo-synchronous code to describe asynchronous computation. An <b>async</b>
        function is a function that implicitly returns a promise and that can, in its body, <b>await</b> other
        promises
        in a way that <i>looks</i> synchronous.</p>
      <p>The <b>async</b> functions and <b>await</b> keyword were added in ECMAScript 2017. These features basically
        act
        as syntactic sugar on top of promises, making asynchronous code easier to write and to read afterwards.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span><code>async</code> keyword</span>: is put in front of a function declaration to turn it into an
          async
          function.
        </li>
        <li><span><code>await</code></span> keyword</span>: await can be put in front of any async promise-based
          function
          to pause your code
          on that line until the promise fulfills, then return the resulting value.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Instead of needing to chain an <code>.then()</code> on the end of each promised-based method, you just need
        to
        add an <code>await</code> keyword before the method call, and then assign the result to a variable.</p>
      <p>Also, <b>async/await</b> is built on top of <b>promises</b>, so it's compatible with all the features offered
        by promises.</p>

      <h2>React</h2>
      <h3 id="react-1">What is React?</h3>
      <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building
        user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a comunity of individual developers and
        companies. It can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.</p>
      <p>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook, who released an early prototype of React
        called "FaxJS". He was influenced by XHP, and HTML component library for PHP. It was first deployed on
        Facebook's news Feed in 2011 and later on Instagram in 2012, and open-sourced on 2013.</p>
      <h3 id="react-2">JSX</h3>
      <p>JSX(JavaScript Syntax Extension) is an extension to the JavaScript language syntax, which provides a way to
        structure
        component rendering.</p>
      <p>Instead of artificially separating <i>techonologies</i> by putting markup and logic in separate files, React
        separates <i>concerns</i> with loosely coupled units called "components" that contain both.</p>
      <p>React doesn't require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside
        the
        JavaScript code.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.</li>
        <li>JSX is an expression too, which means that you can use JSX inside of <code>if</code> statements and
          <code>for</code> loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.
        </li>
        <li>Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, ReactDOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead
          of HTML
          attribute names.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="react-3">Rendering Elements</h3>
      <p>Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are
        plain
        objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.</p>
      <p>Somewhere inside the HTML file there is a "root" DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by
        React
        DOM.
        Applications built with React usually have a single root DOM node.</p>
      <p>To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to <code>ReactDOM.render()</code>.</p>
      <p>React elements are <b>immutable</b>.</p>

      <h3 id="react-4">Components and Props</h3>
      <p>Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.
        Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs(called "props") and
        return
        React
        elements describing what should appear on the screen.</p>
      <h4>Function and Class Components</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A function is a valid React component if it accepts "props" object argument with adata and returns a React
          element. We call such compoenents "function components".</li>
        <li>You can also use an ES6 class to define a component.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Rendering a Component</h4>
      <p>React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags, so by convention <b>component names are
          written
          starting with a capital letter</b>.</p>
      <h4>Composing Components</h4>
      <p>Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for
        any
        level of detail.</p>
      <h4>Prop System</h4>
      <p>A system for passing data from a parent component to a <b>child</b> or <b>nested</b> component. The general
        goal is
        to customize child components in order for them to react to user's input.</p>
      <h4>Class Based Component</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Easier code organization.</li>
        <li>Can use react 'state' system, which makes it easier to handle user input.</li>
        <li>Can use lifecycle methods, which makes it easier to do things when the app first starts.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5>State Rules</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Only usable with class components.</li>
        <li>'State' is a JS object that contains data relevant to a component.</li>
        <li>Updating state on a component causes the component to render.</li>
        <li>State must be initialized when a component is created.</li>
        <li>State can only be updated using the function 'setState'.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="react-5">Lifecycle Methods</h3>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span><b><code>constructor()</code></b></span>: Initializing local state by assigning an object to
          <code>this.state</code>. Or for binding event handler methods to an instance.
        </li>
        <li><span><b><code>render()</code></b></span>: It is the only <b>required</b> method in a class component. It
          should
          <code>return</code> JSX.
        </li>
        <li><span><b><code>componentDidMount()</code></b></span>: Is invoked immediately after a component is
          mounted(inserted
          into the tree). Initialization that require DOM nodes should go here. Also, if you need to load data from a
          remote
          endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.</li>
        <li><span><b><code>componentDidUpdate()</code></b></span>: Is invoked immediately after updating occurs. This
          method
          is not called for the initial render. Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when component has
          been
          updated. This is also a good place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to
          previous
          props.</li>
        <li><span><b><code>componentWillUnmount()</code></b></span>: Is invoked immediately before a component is
          unmounted
          and destroyed. Perdorm any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network
          requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in <code>componentDidMount()</code>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="react-6">Forms</h3>
      <p>HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally
        keep some
        internal state.
      </p>
      <h4>Controlled Components</h4>
      <p>In HTML, form elements such as <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, and
        <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React,
        mutable
        state is typically kept in the state property of components and only updated with <code>setState()</code>.
      </p>
      <p>We can combine the two by making the React state be the "single source of truth". Then the React component
        that
        renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose
        value is
        controlled by React in this way is called a "controlled component".
      </p>

        </table>
      </details>
      <h4>Uncontrolled Components</h4>
      <p>In the uncontrolled components the form data id handled by the DOM itself. To write an uncontrolled
        component,
        instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a <code>ref</code> to get form values
        from the
        DOM.</p>
      <p>Since an uncontrolled component keeps the source of truth in the DOM, it is sometimes easier to integrate
        React
        and
        non-React code when using uncontrolled components. It can also be slightly less code if you want to be quick
        and
        "dirty". Otherwise, it is recommended to use controlled components.</p>

      <h3 id="react-7">Router</h3>
      <p>React Router is a collection of <span>navigational components</span> that compose declaratively with your
        application. Whether you want to have <span>bookmarkable URLs</span> for your web app or a composable way to
        navigate in React Native, React Router works wherever React is rendering.</p>
      <h4>Primary Components</h4>
      <p>There are three primary categories of components in React Router:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>routers, like <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt; </code> and <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code></li>
        <li>route matchers, like <code>&lt;Route&gt; </code> and <code> &lt;Switch&gt;</code></li>
        <li>and navigation, like <code>&lt;Link&gt;, &lt;NavLink&gt;</code>, and <code> &lt;Redirect&gt;</code></li>
      </ul>
      <h5>Routers</h5>
      <p>At the core of every React Router application should be a router component. For web projects, react-router-dom
        provides <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code> routers. The main difference
        between the two is the way they store the URL and communicate with your web server.</p>

      <p>&gt;A <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code> uses regular URL paths. These are
        generally the best-looking URLs, but
        they require your server to be configured correctly. Specifically, your web server needs to serve the same
        page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router.</p>
      <p>&gt;A <code>&lt;HashRouter&gt;</code> stores the current location in the <span>hash portion of the URL</span>,
        so the URL looks something like <span><i>http://example.com/#/your/page</i></span>. Since the hash is never
        sent to the server, this means that no special server configuration is needed.</p>
      <p>*** To use a router, just make sure it is rendered at the root of your element hierarchy.</p>
      <h5>Route Matchers</h5>
      <p>There are two route matching components: <code>Switch</code> and <code>Route</code>. When a
        <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> is rendered, it searches through its <code>children</code>
        <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> elements to find one whose path matches the current URL. When it finds one, it
        renders that <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> and ignores all others. This means that you should put
        <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code>s with more specific (typically longer) paths <i>before</i> less-specific ones.
      </p>
      <p>If no <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> matches , the <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> renders nothing (<code>null</code>).
      </p>
      <p>One important thing to note is that a <code>&lt;Route path&gt;</code> matches the <i>beginning</i> of the URL,
        not the whole thing. So a <code>&lt;Route path='/'&gt;</code> will <i>always</i> match the URL. Because of this,
        we typically put this <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> last in our <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>. Another possible
        solution is to use <code>&lt;Route exact path='/'&gt;</code> which does match the entire URL.</p>
      <h5>Navigation (or Route Changers)</h5>
      <p>React Router provides a <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> component to create links in your application. Wherever you
        render a <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code>, an anchor (<code>&lt;a&gt;</code>) will be rendered in your HTML document.
      </p>
      <p>The <code>&lt;NavLink&gt;</code> is a special type of <code>&lt;Link&gt;</code> that can style itself as
        "active" when its <code>to</code> prop matches the current location.</p>
      <p>Any time you want to force navigation, you can render a <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code>. When a
        <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code> renders, it will navigate using its <code>to</code> prop.
      </p>
      <h3 id="react-8">Portals</h3>
      <p>Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of
        the parent component.</p>
      <p><code>ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)</code></p>
      <p>The first argument (<code>child</code>) is any <span>renderable React child,</span> such as an element, string,
        or fragment. The second argument (<code>container</code>) is a DOM element.</p>

      <h4>Usage</h4>
      <p>Normally, when you return an element from a component's render method, it's mounted into the DOM as a child of
        the nearest parent node. However, sometimes it's useful to insert a child into a different location in the DOM.
      </p>
      <p>A typical use case for portals is when a parent component has an <code>overflow: hidden</code> or
        <code>z-index</code> style, but you need the child to visually "break out" of it's container. For example,
        dialogs, hovercards, and tooltips.
      </p>

      <h4>Event Bubbling Through Portals</h4>
      <p>Even though a portal can be anywhere in the DOM tree, it behaves like a normal React child in every other way.
        Features like context work exactly the same regardless of whether the child is a portal as the portal still
        exists in the <i>React tree</i> regarfless of position in the <i>DOM tree</i>.</p>
      <p>This includes event bubbling. An event fired from inside a portal will propagate to ancestors in the containing
        <i>React tree</i>, even if those elements are not ancestors in the <i>DOM tree</i>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="react-9">Redux</h3>
      <p>As the requirements for JavaScript single-page applications have become increasingly complicated, our code must
        manage more state thant ever before. This state can include server responses and cached data, as well as locally
        created data that has not yet been persisted to the server. UI state is also increasing in complexity, as we
        need to manage active routes, selected tabs, spinners, pagination controls, and so on.</p>
      <p>This complexity is difficult to handle as we're mixing two concepts that are very hard for the human mind to
        reason about: <i>mutation and asynchronicity</i>. Just like Mentos and Coke. Both can be great in separation,
        but together they create a mess. Libraries like React attempt to solve this problem in the view layer by
        removing both asynchrony and direct DOM manipulation. However, managing the state of your data is left to up to
        you. This is where Redux enters.</p>
      <p>Following the steps of Flux, CQRS, and Event Sourcing, Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by
        imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen.</p>
      <h4>Three Principles</h4>
      <p>Redux can be described in three fundamental principles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Single source of thruth</b><br>The global state of your application is stored in an object tree within a
          single store.</li>
        <li><b>State is read-only</b><br>The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing
          what happened.</li>
        <li><b>Changes are made with pure functions</b><br>To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you
          write pure reducers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Redux itself is a standalone library that can be used with any UI layer or framework, including React, Angular,
        Vue, Ember, and vanilla JS. Although Redux and React are commonly used together, they are independent of each
        other.</p>
      <p>React Redux is the official Redux UI binding library for React. </p>
      <h4>When to use Redux</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>You have large amounts of application state that are needed inmany places in the app</li>
        <li>The app state is updated frequently</li>
        <li>The logic to update that state may be complex</li>
        <li>The app has a medium or large-size codebase, and might be worked on by many people</li>
        <li>You need to see how that state is being updated over time</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Steps for integration with a UI</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a Redux store</li>
        <li>Subscribe to updates</li>
        <li>Inside the subscription callback:

      <h4>Redux-Thunk</h4>
      <p>The word "thunk" is a programming term that means "a piece of code that does some delayed work". Rather than
        execute some logic <i>now</i>, we can write a function body or code that can be used to perform the work
        <i>later</i>.
      </p>
      <p>For Redux specifically, <b>"thunks" are a pattern of writing functions with logic inside that can interact with
          a Redux store's <code>dispatch</code> and <code>getState</code> methods</b>.</p>
      <p>Using thunks requires the <code>redux-thunk</code> middleware to be added to the Redux store as part of its
        configuuration.</p>
      <h5>Writing Thunks</h5>
      <p>
        A <i>thunk function</i> is a function that accepts two arguments: the Redux store <code>dispatch</code> method,
        and the Redux store <code>getState</code> method.
        Thunk functions are not directly called by application code. Instead, they are passed to
        <code>store.dispatch()</code>:
      </p>
      <p>A thunk function may contain <i>any</i> arbitrary logic, sync or async, and can call <code>dispatch</code> or
        <code>getState</code> at any time.
      </p>
      <p>In the same way that Redux code normally uses <span>action creators to generate action objeccts for
          dispatching</span> instead of writing action objects by hand, we normally use <i>thunk action creators</i> to
        generate the thunk functions that are dispatched. A thunk action creator is a function that may have some
        arguments, and returns a new thunk function. The thunk typically closes over any arguments passed to the action
        creator, so they can be used in the logic.</p>
      <h5>Why use Thunks?</h5>
      <p>
        Thunks allow us to write additional Redux-related logic separate from UI layer. This logic can include side
        efffects, such as async requests or generating random values, as well as logic that requires dispatching
        multiple actions or access to the Redux store state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Redux reducers <span>must not contain side effects</span>, but real applications require logic that has side
        effects. Some of that may live inside components, but some may need to tlive outside the UI layer. Thunks (and
        other Redux middleware) give us a place to put those side effects.
      </p>
      <p>It's common to have logic directly in components, such as making an async request in a click handler or a
        <code>useEffect</code> hook and then processing the results. However, it's often necessary to move as much of
        that logic as possible outside the UI layer. This may be done to improve testability of the logic, to keep the
        UI layer as thin and "presentational" as possible, or to improve code reuse and sharing.</p>
      <p>In a sense, a thunk is a loophole where <b>you can write any code that needs to interact with the Redux store,
          ahead of time, without needing to know <i>which</i> Redux store will be used</b>. This keeps the logic from
        being bound to any specific Redux store instance and keeps it reusable.</p>
